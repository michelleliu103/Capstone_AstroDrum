# w210-capstone-astrodrum

## Concept

Incorporate a backend machine learning concept using GANs to generate a potentially unlimited supply of drum sounds which will can be utilized in a user friendly interface for music generation and beat mixing.

### Repo Layout

#### Basics
Induction/Prototype code to capture the basics of wave file processing in Python.

#### Frontend
Code for our website, which includes our user interface for beat generation.

#### Wavegan
Copy of wavegan repository (references within) which we utilized and experimented with in our GAN model learning and generation of synthetic audio files

#### Code
Additional code artificats for generating our synthetic sound files from our trained GAN models.  Key file here is SoundGenerator.ipynb

### Process
