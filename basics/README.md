This is the most basic 'model' for generating new kick drum sounds. It takes two random kicks given a directory of kick samples, cuts each into two parts and merges the first of one with the end of the other

#### WAV Basics 4
Basic cut at using model checkpoint files to generate new drum sounds

#### Create Snaps and Booms from Kicks
Decompose a kick drum sound into its two key components using WAV splicing

#### Create Many Kicks Using Splice and Melt
We splice our Kick drum sounds from its decomposed components to generate new audio
